# Task Manager Application

## Description
This Task Manager application allows users to:
- Add new tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- View a list of tasks

The app is built using Node.js and Express, with EJS as the templating engine. It uses in-memory storage, so tasks will not persist across server restarts.

## Setup Instructions
1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Start the server with `npm start`.
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/view` in your browser to view and interact with the Task Manager.
